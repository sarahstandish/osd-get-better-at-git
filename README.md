# osd-get-better-at-git
This repository will be used by attendees of the OSD Summer'21 workshop "Get better at Git : End chaos in your collaboration".  
Use the [GitHub-Party.pdf](Get-better-at-git.pdf) as a guide and follow the steps to learn and have fun.  Happy Partying!

If you are completely new to git/Github ecosystem or just getting started, we would recommend going through Github 101 guide [here](https://github.com/renana/osd-github-101/blob/main/Github%20101%20OSD%20Summer%202021.pdf).

Practice editing documentation is a good way to get better at git.
